# Syntax
# Define an empty class:

class MyClass():
    pass

# Instantiate an object of a class:

class MyClass():
     pass
 mc_1 = MyClass()

# Define an init function in a class to assign an attribute at instantiation:

class MyClass():
    def __init__(self, param_1):
        self.attribute_1 = param_1
mc_2 = MyClass("arg_1")

# Define a method inside a class and call it on an instantiated object:

class MyClass():
    def __init__(self, param_1):
        self.attribute_1 = param_1
    def add_20(self):
        self.attribute_1 += 20
mc_3 = MyClass(10) # mc_3.attribute is 10
mc_3.add_20()        # mc_3.attribute is 30

# Concepts
# In Object-Oriented Programming, the fundamental building blocks are objects.
# It differs from Procedural programming, where sequential steps are executed.
# An object is an entity that stores data.
# A class describes an object's type. It defines:
# What data is stored in the object, known as attributes.
# What actions the object can do, known as methods.
# An attribute is a variable that belongs to an instance of a class.
# A method is a function that belongs to an instance of a class.
# Attributes and methods are accessed using dot notation. Attributes do not use parentheses, whereas methods do.
# An instance describes a specific example of a class. For instance, in the code x = 3, x is an instance of the type int.
# When an object is created, it is known as instantiation.
# A class definition is code that defines how a class behaves, including all methods and attributes.
# The init method is a special method that runs at the moment an object is instantiated.
# The init method (__init__()) is one of a number of special methods that Python defines.
# All methods must include self, representing the object instance, as their first parameter.
# It is convention to start the name of any attributes or methods that aren't intended for external use with an underscore.
