#Syntax
#Storing values to variables:

twenty = 20
result = 43 + 2**5
currency = 'USD'

#Updating the value stored in a variable:

x = 30
x += 10 # this is the same as x = x + 10

#Rounding a number:

round(4.99) # the output will be 5

#Using quotation marks to create a string:

app_name = "Clash of Clans"
app_rating = '3.5'

#Concatenating two or more strings:

print('a' + 'b') # prints 'ab'
print('a' + 'b' + 'c') # prints 'abc'

#Converting between types of variables:

int('4')
str(4)
float('4.3')
str(4.3)

#Finding the type of a value:

type(4)
type('4')

#Concepts
#We can store values in the computer memory. Each storage location in the computer's memory is called a variable.
#There are two syntax rules we need to be aware of when we're naming variables:
#We must use only letters, numbers, or underscores (we can't use apostrophes, hyphens, whitespace characters, etc.).
#Variable names can't start with a number.
#Whenever the syntax is correct, but the computer still returns an error for one reason or another, we say we got a runtime error.
#In Python, the = operator tells us that the value on the right is assigned to the variable on the left. It doesn't tell us anything about equality. We call = an assignment operator, and we read code like x = 5 as "five is assigned to x" or "x is assigned five," but not "x equals five."
#In computer programming, values are classified into different types, or data types. The type of a value offers the computer the required information about how to handle that value. Depending on the type, the computer will know how to store a value in memory, or what operations can and can't be performed on a value.
#In this mission, we learned about three data types: integers, floats, and strings.
#The process of linking two or more strings together is called concatenation.
