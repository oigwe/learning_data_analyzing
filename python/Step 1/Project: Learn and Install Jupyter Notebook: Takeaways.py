#Concepts
#Jupyter Notebook is much more complex than a code editor. Jupyter allows us to:
#Type and execute code.
#Add accompanying text to our code (including math equations).
#Add visualizations.
#Jupyter can run in a browser and is often used to create compelling data science projects that can be easily shared with other people.
#A notebook is a file created using Jupyter notebooks. Notebooks can easily be shared and distributed so people can view your work.
#Types of modes in Jupyter:
#Jupyter is in edit mode whenever we type in a cell — a small pencil icon appears to the right of the menu bar.
#Jupyter is in command mode whenever we press Esc or whenever we click outside of the cell — the pencil to the right of the menu bar disappears.
#State refers to what a computer remembers about a program.
#We can convert a code cell to a Markdown cell to add text to explain our code. Markdown syntax allows us to use keyboard symbols to format our text.
#Installing the Anaconda distribution will install both Python and Jupyter on your computer.
#Keyboard Shortcuts
#Some of the most useful keyboard shortcuts we can use in command mode are:

Ctrl + Enter: run selected cell
Shift + Enter: run cell, select below
Alt + Enter: run cell, insert below
Up: select cell above
Down: select cell below
Enter: enter edit mode
A: insert cell above
B: insert cell below
D, D (press D twice): delete selected cell
Z: undo cell deletion
S: save and checkpoint
Y: convert to code cell
M: convert to Markdown cell
#Some of the most useful keyboard shortcuts we can use in edit mode are:

Ctrl + Enter: run selected cell
Shift + Enter: run cell, select below
Alt + Enter: run cell, insert below
Up: move cursor up
Down: move cursor down
Esc: enter command mode
Ctrl + A: select all
Ctrl + Z: undo
Ctrl + Y: redo
Ctrl + S: save and checkpoint
Tab : indent or code completion
Shift + Tab: tooltip
