#Syntax
#Creating a function with a single parameter:

def square(number):
    return number**2

#Creating a function with more than one parameter:

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

#Reusing a function within another function's definition:

def add_to_square(x):
    return square(x) + 1000  # we defined square() above

#Concepts
#Generally, a function displays this pattern:
#It takes in an input.
#It does something to that input.
#It gives back an output.
#In Python, we have built-in functions like sum(), max(), min(), len(), and print(), and functions that we create ourselves.
#Structurally, a function is composed of a header (which contains the def statement), a body, and a return statement.
#Input variables are called parameters, and the various values that parameters take are called arguments. In def square(number), the number variable is a parameter. In square(number=6), the value 6 is an argument that is passed to the parameter number.
#Arguments that are passed by name are called keyword arguments (the parameters give the name). When we use multiple keyword arguments, the order we use doesn't make any practical difference.
#Arguments that are passed by position are called positional arguments. When we use multiple positional arguments, the order we use matters.
#Debugging more complex functions can be a bit more challenging, but we can find the bugs by reading the traceback.
