#Syntax
#Initiating parameters with default arguments:

def add_value(x, constant=3.14):
    return x + constant

#Using multiple return statements:

def sum_or_difference(a, b, do_sum):
    if do_sum:
        return a + b
    return a - b

#Returning multiple variables:

def sum_and_difference(a, b):
    a_sum = a + b
    difference = a - b
    return a_sum, difference
sum_1, diff_1 = sum_and_difference(15, 10)

#Concepts
#We need to avoid using the name of a built-in function to name a function or a variable because this overwrites the built-in function.
#Each built-in function is well documented in the official Python documentation.
#Parameters and return statements are not mandatory when we create a function.

def print_constant():
    x = 3.14
    print(x)

#The code inside a function definition is executed only when the function is called.

#When a function is called, the variables defined inside the function definition are saved into a temporary memory that is erased immediately after the function finishes running. The temporary memory associated with a function is isolated from the memory associated with the main program (the main program is the part of the program outside function definitions).
#The part of a program where a variable can be accessed is often called scope. The variables defined in the main program are said to be in the global scope, while the variables defined inside a function are in the local scope.
#Python searches the global scope if a variable is not available in the local scope, but the reverse doesn't apply. Python won't search the local scope if it doesn't find a variable in the global scope. Even if it searched the local scope, the memory associated with a function is temporary, so the search would be pointless.
