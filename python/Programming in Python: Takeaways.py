#Displaying the output of a computer program:

print(1 + 2)
print(5 * 10)

#Ignoring certain lines of code by using code comments:

# print(1 + 2)
print(5 * 10)
# This program will only print 50

#Performing arithmetical operations:

1 + 2
4 - 5
30 * 1
20 / 3
4**3
(4 * 18)**2 / 10

#Concepts
#When we give a computer a set of instructions, we say that we're programming it. To program a computer, we need to write the instructions in a special language, which we call a programming language.
#Python has syntax rules, and each line of instruction has to comply with these rules. For example, print(23 + 7) print(10 - 6) print(12 + 38) doesn't comply with Python's syntax rules and raises a syntax error.
#The instructions we send to the computer are collectively known as code. Each line of instruction is known as a line of code.
#When we write code, we program the computer to do something. For this reason, we also call the code we write a computer program, or a program.
#The code we write serves as input to the computer. The result of executing the code is called output.
#The sequence of characters that follows the # symbol is called a code comment. We can use code comments to stop the computer executing a line of code or add information about the code we write.
