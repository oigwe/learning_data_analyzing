# Syntax
# SELECTING ROWS, COLUMNS, AND ITEMS FROM AN NDARRAY
# Convert a list of lists into a ndarray:

import numpy as np
f = open("nyc_taxis.csv", "r")
taxi_list = list(csv.reader(f))
taxi = np.array(converted_taxi_list)

# Selecting a row from an ndarray:

second_row = taxi[1]

# Selecting multiple rows from an ndarray:

all_but_first_row = taxi[1:]

# Selecting a specific item from an ndarray:

fifth_row_second_column = taxi[4,1]

# SLICING VALUES FROM AN NDARRAY
# Selecting a single column:

second_column = taxi[:,1]

# Selecting multiple columns:

second_third_columns = taxi[:,1:3]
cols = [1,3,5]
second_fourth_sixth_columns = taxi[:, cols]

# Selecting a 2D slice:

twod_slice = taxi[1:4, :3]

# VECTOR MATH
vector_a + vector_b: Addition
vector_a - vector_b: Subtraction
vector_a * vector_b: Multiplication (this is unrelated to the vector multiplication used in linear algebra).
vector_a / vector_b: Division
# CALCULATING STATISTICS FOR 1D NDARRAYS
ndarray.min() to calculate the minimum value
ndarray.max() to calculate the maximum value
ndarray.mean() to calculate the mean average value
ndarray.sum() to calculate the sum of the values
# CALCULATING STATISTICS FOR 2D NDARRAYS
Max value for an entire 2D Ndarray:

taxi.max()

Max value for each row in a 2D Ndarray (returns a 1D Ndarray):

taxi.max(axis=1)

Max value for each column in a 2D Ndarray (returns a 1D Ndarray):

taxi.max(axis=0)

# Concepts
# Python is considered a high-level language because we don't have to manually allocate memory or specify how the CPU performs certain operations. A low-level language like C gives us this control and lets us improve specific code performance, but a tradeoff in programmer productivity is made. The NumPy library lets us write code in Python but take advantage of the performance that C offers. One way NumPy makes our code run quickly is vectorization, which takes advantage of Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) to process data more quickly.
# A list in NumPy is called a 1D Ndarray and a list of lists is called a 2D Ndarray. NumPy ndarrays use indices along both rows and columns and is the primary way we select and slice values.
