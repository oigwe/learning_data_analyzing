# IMPORTING MODULES AND DEFINITIONS
# Importing a whole module:

import csv
csv.reader()

# Importing a whole module with an alias:

import csv as c
c.reader()

# Importing a single definition:

from csv import reader
reader()

# Importing multiple definitions:

from csv import reader, writer
reader()
writer()

# Importing all definitions:

from csv import *

# WORKING WITH THE DATETIME MODULE
# All examples below presume the following import code:

import datetime as dt

# Creating datetime.datetime object given a month, year, and day:

eg_1 = dt.datetime(1985, 3, 13)

# Creating a datetime.datetime object from a string:

eg_2 = dt.datetime.strptime("24/12/1984", "%d/%m/%Y")

# Converting a datetime.datetime object to a string:

dt_object = dt.datetime(1984, 12, 24)
dt_string = dt_object.strftime("%d/%m/%Y")

# Instantiating a datetime.time object:

eg_3 = datetime.time(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

# Retrieving a part of a date stored in the datetime.datetime object:

eg_1.day

# Creating a datetime.time object from a datetime.datetime object:

d2_dt = dt.datetime(1946, 9, 10)
d2 = d2_dt.time()

# Creating a datetime.time object from a string:

d3_str = "17 February 1963"
d3_dt = dt.datetime.strptime(d3_str, "%d %B %Y")
d3 = d3_dt.time()

# Instantiating a datetime.timedelta object:

eg_4 = dt.timedelta(weeks=3)

# Adding a time period to a datetime.datetime object:

d1 = dt.date(1963, 2, 26)
d1_plus_1wk = d1 + dt.timedelta(weeks=1)

# Concepts
# The datetime module contains the following classes:
# datetime.datetime: For working with date and time data
# datetime.time: For working with time data only
# datetime.timedelta: For representing time periods
# Time objects behave similarly to datetime objects for the following reasons:
# They have attributes like time.hour and time.second that you can use to access individual time components.
# They have a time.strftime() method, which you can use to create a formatted string representation of the object.
# The timedelta type represents a period of time, e.g. 30 minutes or two days.
# Common format codes when working with datetime.datetime.strptime: 
# Strftime Code	Meaning	Examples
%d	Day of the month as a zero-padded number1	04
%A	Day of the week as a word2	Monday
%m	Month as a zero-padded number1	09
%Y	Year as a four-digit number	1901
%y	Year as a two-digit number with zero-padding1, 3	01 (2001)
88 (1988)
%B	Month as a word2	September
%H	Hour in 24 hour time as zero-padded number1	05 (5 a.m.)
15 (3 p.m.)
%p	a.m. or p.m.2	AM
%I	Hour in 12 hour time as zero-padded number1	05 (5 a.m., or 5 p.m. if AM/PM indicates otherwise)
%M	Minute as a zero-padded number1	07 1. The strptime parser will parse non-zero padded numbers without raising an error.
# 2. Date parts containing words will be interpreted using the locale settings on your computer, so strptime won't be able to parse 'febrero' (february in Spanish) if your locale is set to an english language locale.
# 3. Year values from 00-68 will be interpreted as 2000-2068, with values 70-99 interpreted as 1970-1999.

# Operations between timedelta, datetime, and time objects (datetime can be substituted with time): 
# Operation	Explanation	Resultant Type
datetime - datetime	Calculate the time between two specific dates/times	timedelta
datetime - timedelta	Subtract a time period from a date or time.	datetime
datetime + timedelta	Add a time period to a date or time.	datetime
timedelta + timedelta	Add two periods of time together	timedelta
timedelta - timedelta	Calculate the difference between two time periods.	timedelta
